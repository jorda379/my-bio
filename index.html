            <h2 class="highlight">About</h2>
            <p>My name is Yordanos. According to ,<span><i>Google translation</i></span>this is how you write my name in arabic: <bdo dir="rtl">يوردانس</bdo> (b.t.w you read it in arabic right to left). Arabic  is one of the many languages spoken in Eritrea, however Tirgrinya is the official language. I am from Eritrea but I was raised in Sweden. My background is in administration. I studied some Web Design in school in Sweden. However I am new to the field of web development.</p> 
            <p> Fun facts about me: I love tea, but some mornings I just want some N<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>0<sub>2</sub> (in other words caffeine—one cup will do). Whether I drink tea or coffee I always make sure to drink a lot of H<sup>2</sup>O, i.e water—lots of water during the day.

                    <p>There is so much to share about each city. I thought I share what make each city unique.</p> 
                    <p> It is <mark>important</mark> to state that I lived in <strong>Asmara</strong> only as a child and therefore I do not know much about the city.   As a consequence I had to research the city online. I also used web resources to gather information about the  other cities featured here. But <em>Stockholm</em> is the city I lived in the <mark>longest</mark> out all four cities and hence the city I know best. </p>

            <p> It has been almost a month since I moved to Toronto from Sweden to study. On the 6 of January we had the first class in Web Design and Development.

We are on our second week and it is our second class in all the courses. We have handed in several in-class exercises.</p>
